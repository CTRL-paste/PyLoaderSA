# Extending-functionality

The functionality of the plugin can be extended through python modules or external C++ DLL files. After creating your module put them inside the 'lib' folder. You can import them as usual afterward.

To know about creating python modules, check [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm#:~:text=A%20module%20is%20a%20Python,can%20also%20include%20runnable%20code.)

For creating modules through C++ \(advanced\), check for sample [here](https://github.com/user-grinch/PyLoaderSA/tree/plugin-template). More examples are [here](https://github.com/user-grinch/PyLoaderSA/tree/master/PyLoader/sdk)
